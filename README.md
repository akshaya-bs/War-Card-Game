# War-Card-Game
This project implements a modified version of the classic card game War using C++. The game features unique gameplay mechanics, including a deck system implemented as a queue using a linked list, and a side pile system implemented as a stack using an array. Players can make strategic decisions to push or pull cards, adding depth to the traditional War game.
